# Feature Specification: Right-Click Context Menu for Opening Preview

**Feature Branch**: `003-do-i-already`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Do i already have a specification for opening the preview by rightclicking the open document and then having an option to do so?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: actors (users editing markdown), actions (right-click, open preview), data (markdown document), constraints (must be active document)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: right-click on document ‚Üí select menu option ‚Üí preview opens
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí No new entities (operates on existing markdown documents)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: When a preview is already open for the document and the user selects the context menu option again, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Focus the existing preview panel (bring it to front if hidden)
- Q: What should the context menu label text be? ‚Üí A: Show Easy Read Preview
- Q: Where should the "Show Easy Read Preview" option appear in the context menu? ‚Üí A: No specific positioning requirement (default placement)
- Q: Should the context menu option include an icon, and if so, what type? ‚Üí A: No icon required

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user editing a markdown file, I want to right-click on the active document and select an option to open a preview, so that I can quickly view the rendered markdown without needing to remember keyboard shortcuts or use the command palette.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a markdown file is open and active in the editor, **When** the user right-clicks anywhere in the document, **Then** a context menu appears with an option to open the markdown preview
2. **Given** a markdown file is open and active, **When** the user selects the preview option from the right-click context menu, **Then** the preview opens showing the rendered markdown content
3. **Given** a non-markdown file is open and active, **When** the user right-clicks in the document, **Then** the markdown preview option does not appear in the context menu
4. **Given** the markdown preview is already open for a document, **When** the user right-clicks and selects the preview option again, **Then** the system focuses the existing preview panel (brings it to front if hidden)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user right-clicks on a markdown file in the file explorer sidebar (not the editor)?
- What happens when multiple markdown files are open but none are currently active?
- What happens when a markdown file is in a diff view or split editor?
- Should the context menu option be available when right-clicking in the preview itself?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST add a context menu option to open the markdown preview when a markdown file is the active editor
- **FR-002**: System MUST show the context menu option only for markdown files (not for other file types)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to trigger the preview opening by right-clicking anywhere in the active markdown document and selecting the menu option
- **FR-004**: System MUST open the preview in the same manner as when triggered by other methods (keyboard shortcut, command palette)
- **FR-005**: The context menu option MUST be labeled "Show Easy Read Preview"
- **FR-006**: The context menu option MAY appear in the default position provided by the editor platform (no specific positioning constraint)
- **FR-007**: System MUST focus the existing preview panel (bring it to front) when a preview is already open and the user selects the context menu option again
- **FR-008**: The context menu option does not require an icon (text-only menu item)
- **FR-009**: The context menu option MAY show the associated keyboard shortcut (if one exists) as a hint to users

## Notes

The feature builds upon existing preview functionality and focuses solely on adding an alternative access method through the right-click context menu. All critical ambiguities have been resolved through the clarification session.
