# Feature Specification: Enhanced Code Display and Context Menu Preview

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-2-features`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add 2 features better display of code, auto language recognition. Open preview by right clicking file"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: What specific visual enhancements should "better display" include for code blocks? ‚Üí A: Syntax highlighting + line numbers + copy button
- Q: When a code block has an explicit language tag (e.g., ```python), how should the system behave? ‚Üí A: Honor explicit tag, but warn if detected language differs
- Q: How should the context menu behave for non-markdown files? ‚Üí A: Option appears only for .md files, not for other extensions
- Q: Should the context menu support markdown file extensions beyond .md? ‚Üí A: All common markdown extensions (.md, .markdown, .mdown, .mkd, .mkdn, .mdwn, .text)
- Q: When opening a markdown file from the context menu, how should the preview appear? ‚Üí A: User-configurable preference in settings

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: code display enhancement, language detection, context menu integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: markdown file viewers/readers
   ‚Üí Actions: view code blocks, detect language, open preview via context menu
   ‚Üí Data: markdown files with code blocks
   ‚Üí Constraints: None specified
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Does "better display" mean syntax highlighting, or something else?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should language auto-recognition override explicit language tags?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should context menu appear on all files or only .md files?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow identified for both features
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements defined with clarification markers
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí No persistent data entities involved
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for clarification and planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a markdown file reader, I want to see code blocks with better visual presentation and automatic language detection so that I can easily read and understand code examples without manually specifying languages. Additionally, I want to quickly open markdown files in the Easy Read preview by right-clicking them in the file explorer.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Feature 1: Enhanced Code Display with Auto Language Recognition
1. **Given** a markdown file contains a code block with an explicit language tag (e.g., ```javascript), **When** the user opens the preview, **Then** the code block displays with appropriate visual formatting for that language
2. **Given** a markdown file contains a code block without a language tag, **When** the user opens the preview, **Then** the system automatically detects the language and displays the code with appropriate formatting
3. **Given** a markdown file contains a code block with an incorrect or unsupported language tag, **When** the user opens the preview, **Then** the code block displays with the specified language formatting and a warning is shown if auto-detection suggests a different language
4. **Given** a markdown file contains mixed-language code blocks, **When** the user opens the preview, **Then** each code block displays with its respective language formatting

#### Feature 2: Context Menu Preview Access
1. **Given** a user is viewing files in VS Code explorer, **When** the user right-clicks on a markdown file, **Then** a context menu option "Open with Markdown Easy Read" appears
2. **Given** a user has right-clicked on a markdown file, **When** the user selects "Open with Markdown Easy Read" from the context menu, **Then** the file opens in the Markdown Easy Read preview
3. **Given** a user right-clicks on a non-markdown file, **When** the context menu appears, **Then** the "Open with Markdown Easy Read" option does not appear

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a code block contains ambiguous syntax that could match multiple languages?
- How does the system handle very large code blocks (performance consideration)?
- What happens when a user right-clicks multiple markdown files simultaneously?
- How does the system handle markdown files with no extension or unusual extensions?
- What happens if code blocks contain special characters or Unicode that might affect language detection?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Enhanced Code Display
- **FR-001**: System MUST display code blocks with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and a copy button
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect the programming language of code blocks that lack an explicit language tag
- **FR-003**: System MUST honor explicit language tags in code blocks, but display a warning if the auto-detected language differs significantly from the specified tag
- **FR-004**: System MUST support common programming languages including [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum set of languages required - JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, etc.?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle code blocks with no detectable language by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: display as plain text with monospace font, show as unformatted, or indicate detection failure?]
- **FR-006**: Code display MUST adapt to the current VS Code theme (light/dark/high-contrast)
- **FR-007**: Code blocks MUST remain readable and preserve original formatting (indentation, line breaks, spacing)

#### Context Menu Integration
- **FR-008**: VS Code file explorer context menu MUST include an option to open markdown files with Markdown Easy Read
- **FR-009**: Context menu option MUST be available when right-clicking on files with markdown extensions (.md, .markdown, .mdown, .mkd, .mkdn, .mdwn, .text)
- **FR-009a**: Context menu option MUST NOT appear for files without markdown extensions
- **FR-011**: Selecting the context menu option MUST open the file in Markdown Easy Read preview according to user-configurable preference (replace current view, open in new column, or use VS Code default behavior)
- **FR-011a**: System MUST provide a settings option for users to configure preview window placement behavior
- **FR-012**: Context menu option MUST be clearly labeled and distinguishable from VS Code's built-in markdown preview option

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Language auto-detection MUST complete within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable latency not specified - 100ms, 500ms, 1 second?] for files up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum supported file size not specified]
- **NFR-002**: Code display enhancement MUST NOT significantly increase preview render time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what is "significant" - 10%, 50%, 100% increase?]
- **NFR-003**: Context menu integration MUST NOT conflict with existing VS Code commands or other extensions

## Notes for Planning Phase
Once clarifications are resolved, the planning phase should consider:
- Current markdown-it renderer capabilities and extensibility
- VS Code context menu API and command registration patterns
- Language detection algorithms and libraries available for client-side JavaScript
- Performance implications of adding syntax highlighting to webview rendering
- User preference storage for context menu behavior defaults
