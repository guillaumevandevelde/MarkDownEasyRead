# Feature Specification: Reader-Optimized Markdown Preview

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a visual studio code extension which creates a very user friendly way of previewing and reading a markdown file.

- easy to read preview
- zoomable, or adjustable font size
- Optimized padding and margin for reading
- Preview of images included"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: How should users control font size/zoom in the preview? ‚Üí A: Both keyboard shortcuts AND UI controls
- Q: Where should font size/zoom preferences be saved? ‚Üí A: Global (one zoom setting across all workspaces)
- Q: What should guide the padding/margins and line length design? ‚Üí A: Responsive (adapt to panel width, narrow to wide layouts)
- Q: How should the extension handle VS Code themes and colors? ‚Üí A: Auto-adapt only (inherit VS Code theme colors automatically)
- Q: How should the preview handle wide content (tables, code blocks)? ‚Üí A: Smart hybrid (wrap text, scroll for structured content like tables)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer or technical writer, I want to read markdown documentation in VS Code with an optimized reading experience, so that I can comfortably review and understand long-form documentation without eye strain or distraction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a markdown file open in VS Code, **When** I activate the reader-optimized preview, **Then** the content is displayed with comfortable padding, margins, and typography optimized for extended reading
2. **Given** the preview is active and the text feels too small, **When** I adjust the font size or zoom level, **Then** the text scales appropriately while maintaining readable line lengths and spacing
3. **Given** a markdown file contains embedded images, **When** I view the preview, **Then** all images are rendered inline at appropriate sizes without breaking the reading flow
4. **Given** I am reading a long document, **When** I scroll through the preview, **Then** the layout remains stable and comfortable throughout the entire document

### Edge Cases
- What happens when markdown contains very wide code blocks or tables? (Resolved: Smart hybrid approach - text wraps, structured content scrolls horizontally)
- How does the preview handle malformed markdown syntax?
- What happens when image references are broken or point to non-existent files? (Resolved: Show placeholder or error indicator)
- How does the preview perform with very large markdown files (100+ pages)?
- What happens when the user has custom VS Code themes or color schemes? (Resolved: Auto-adapts to active theme)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Extension MUST provide a command to open markdown files in a reader-optimized preview mode
- **FR-002**: Preview MUST render all standard markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, links, code blocks, blockquotes)
- **FR-003**: Preview MUST display embedded images from relative paths, absolute paths, and URLs
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to adjust font size or zoom level via both keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl/Cmd +/-) and UI controls (buttons or slider in preview panel)
- **FR-005**: Preview MUST apply responsive padding and margins that adapt to panel width (optimized for both narrow and wide layouts)
- **FR-006**: Preview MUST maintain comfortable line length for reading that adapts responsively to panel width
- **FR-007**: Font size/zoom preferences MUST persist globally across all VS Code sessions and workspaces
- **FR-008**: Preview MUST update when the underlying markdown file changes
- **FR-009**: Preview MUST handle broken image references gracefully (show placeholder or error indicator)
- **FR-010**: Extension MUST automatically inherit and adapt to the active VS Code theme colors (both light and dark themes)
- **FR-011**: Preview MUST handle wide content using smart hybrid approach (wrap text in code blocks where reasonable, enable horizontal scrolling for structured content like tables)

### Key Entities
- **Markdown Document**: The source file being previewed, containing text content with markdown syntax and image references
- **Preview Panel**: The rendered view that displays the formatted markdown with optimized reading layout
- **User Preferences**: Settings for font size/zoom level, theme preferences, and layout options that persist across sessions
